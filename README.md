<h2>About the project</h2>
<h3>This section</h3>
This project is a simple calculator, it works for basic operations (adding, subtracting, dividing, multiplying).
It is my first project using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I've been going rounds on JS, it was kind of confusing but it's starting to make a bit more sense.
